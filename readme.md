## üí• Challenges faced during project development

### üñ•Ô∏è Compatibility between Mac OS and Windows for files Upload, deletion, and download

One of the primary challenges we encountered was ensuring code compatibility between the Mac OS and Windows operating systems. Specifically, we had to adapt our code to ensure that file upload, deletion, and download functionalities worked consistently on both platforms. Differences in file paths, directory separator characters, and naming conventions required adjustments to ensure a uniform user experience.

### üîí Integrating CSRF protection on files upload forms (enctype="multipart/form-data")

Integrating protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks proved to be a challenge, especially on forms using the enctype="multipart/form-data" attribute for file uploads. Traditional CSRF protection solutions did not seamlessly work with this type of form. We had to research and implement specific approaches to ensure effective CSRF protection without disrupting file upload functionality.

### üì¶ General code structure

The overall code structure was a significant point of concern. As beginners, we sometimes lacked clear and modular organization, making code maintenance and comprehension more challenging over time. We had to rethink and reorganize our code to improve readability, maintainability, and scalability. This included grouping related functionalities, removing redundancies, and adopting consistent naming conventions.

### üöß Establishing effective error handling

Error handling in our application presented another major challenge. We realized that our initial code did not adequately handle errors, which could lead to unexpected behaviors and potential security vulnerabilities. We had to revise our code to implement effective error handling, including exception handling mechanisms, clear error messages for users, and proper error logging for debugging.

### üê≥ Initial steps with Docker implementation and uncertainty

Finally, our experience with Docker for managing our development environment was a new endeavor for us. Concepts like containerization, Docker image creation, and container management required time to fully grasp. We encountered issues related to container configuration, volume synchronization, and dependency management. Moreover, we are not entirely certain that Docker has been correctly implemented in our project. This uncertainty about the accuracy of our Docker configuration necessitated additional adjustments and thorough verification to ensure the stability and consistency of our development environment.

In summary, these challenges encountered during our project have been essential learning opportunities. They have allowed us to develop technical skills, understand real-world software development challenges, and implement tailored solutions to overcome these obstacles.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security measures implemented
- **Helmet** : Secures applications by setting various HTTP headers, protecting against many common web vulnerabilities.
- **Bcryptjs** : Used for hashing passwords before storing them in the database, thus protecting against password theft.
- **Dotenv** : Manages sensitive information such as secret keys and database connection strings, keeping them out of the source code.
- **Csurf** : Provides protection against CSRF attacks, ensuring that each client-side request is legitimate and authorized.
- **Passport and Passport-Local** : Provide robust authentication, ensuring that only authenticated users can access certain routes and functionalities.
- **Multer** : Manages file uploads, allowing control over the types of files uploaded and limiting the risks of executing malicious files.
- **Validator** : Used for validating and sanitizing user inputs, thus preventing SQL injections and XSS attacks.

## üìà Proposals to enhance the security of the "Chat-my-Files" project
To further strengthen the security of the "Chat-my-Files" project, several additional measures can be considered:
- **Implementation of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** : Although the project already uses Passport for authentication, adding two-factor authentication would provide an extra layer of security. This could be achieved using solutions like Authy or Google Authenticator.
- **Encryption of sensitive data** : In addition to hashing passwords, encrypting other sensitive data stored in the database (such as email addresses) would enhance the protection of user data against unauthorized access.
- **Security audits and penetration testing** : Hiring security experts to conduct regular audits and penetration tests would help identify and rectify potential vulnerabilities that might be missed during development.
- **Implementation of a Web Application Firewall (WAF)** : Using a WAF would help protect the application against common web attacks, such as SQL injections, cross-site scripting (XSS), and denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.
- **Use of HTTPS with HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)** : If not already in place, using HTTPS with HSTS would ensure that all communications between the client and the server are encrypted and secure.
- **Limiting login attempts and account lockout** : To prevent brute force attacks, implementing a system to limit login attempts and temporarily lock accounts after a certain number of failed attempts would be beneficial.
- **Antivirus file scanning** : Integration of the ClamScan package or utilization of the VirusTotal API to detect files containing viruses and reject their upload.

## üîç Identifying software weaknesses
At the end of our project, as students, we recognize the importance of implementing a strategy to identify potential software weaknesses, a crucial step for ensuring the security and functionality of our application. While we have not yet implemented testing procedures, we understand that integrating them is essential. Our approach will include initiating a peer review process, where we collaboratively examine the code to learn about common vulnerabilities and best coding practices.

We plan to incorporate automated testing tools suitable for beginners, which will assist us in scanning for security flaws and performance issues. This will be complemented by basic stress and load testing to evaluate how our software performs under different conditions. Additionally, we aim to seek guidance and feedback from more experienced developers or educators, providing us with an external perspective and expert insights.

By adopting this comprehensive approach, we not only aim to identify and rectify current software issues but also to equip ourselves with the necessary skills and knowledge to prevent similar challenges in future projects. Implementing testing procedures will be a significant learning opportunity for us, enhancing our development process and the quality of our software.
