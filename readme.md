# üìÅ Chat-my-Files

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About
Chat-my-Files is a web application designed to enable users to manage files and participate in online chat discussions. It focuses on web security, offering features such as user authentication, role management, and protection against common web attacks.

## üß© Team organization:
One team member handled the creation of the chat feature, another person developed the authentication system and the admin page, and a third member worked on the shared file system.

Primarily, we worked individually on our respective features, collaborating when faced with challenges and assisting each other in implementing various security measures.

## üìö Libraries used
The "Chat-my-Files" project utilizes several key libraries, listed below with their respective versions (as specified in the `package.json` file) :
- Express (v4.18.2): A minimalist and flexible web framework for Node.js, facilitating the creation of web applications and APIs.
- Mongoose (v8.0.1): A MongoDB object modeling library for Node.js.
- EJS (v3.1.9): A simple template engine for creating HTML pages with JavaScript.
- Bcryptjs (v2.4.3): Used for securely hashing passwords.
- Dotenv (v16.3.1): Allows loading environment variables from a .env file.
- Helmet (v7.1.0): Helps secure Express applications by setting various HTTP headers.
- Multer (v1.4.5-lts.1): Middleware for handling file uploads.
- Passport (v0.7.0) and Passport-Local (v1.0.0): Used for user authentication.
- Csurf (v1.11.0): Middleware for protection against CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks.
- Cookie-Parser (v1.4.6): Cookie parser for Express.
- Body-Parser (v1.20.2): Middleware for parsing incoming request bodies in an Express application.
- Validator (v13.11.0): String validation library.

## üîí Security measures implemented
- Helmet: Secures applications by setting various HTTP headers, protecting against many common web vulnerabilities.
- Bcryptjs: Used for hashing passwords before storing them in the database, thus protecting against password theft.
- Dotenv: Manages sensitive information such as secret keys and database connection strings, keeping them out of the source code.
- Csurf: Provides protection against CSRF attacks, ensuring that each client-side request is legitimate and authorized.
- Passport and Passport-Local: Provide robust authentication, ensuring that only authenticated users can access certain routes and functionalities.
- Multer: Manages file uploads, allowing control over the types of files uploaded and limiting the risks of executing malicious files.
- Validator: Used for validating and sanitizing user inputs, thus preventing SQL injections and XSS attacks.

## üìà Proposals to enhance the security of the "Chat-my-Files" project
To further strengthen the security of the "Chat-my-Files" project, several additional measures can be considered:
- Implementation of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Although the project already uses Passport for authentication, adding two-factor authentication would provide an extra layer of security. This could be achieved using solutions like Authy or Google Authenticator.
- Encryption of sensitive data: In addition to hashing passwords, encrypting other sensitive data stored in the database (such as email addresses) would enhance the protection of user data against unauthorized access.
- Security audits and penetration testing: Hiring security experts to conduct regular audits and penetration tests would help identify and rectify potential vulnerabilities that might be missed during development.
- Implementation of a Web Application Firewall (WAF): Using a WAF would help protect the application against common web attacks, such as SQL injections, cross-site scripting (XSS), and denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.
- Use of HTTPS with HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security): If not already in place, using HTTPS with HSTS would ensure that all communications between the client and the server are encrypted and secure.
- Limiting login attempts and account lockout: To prevent brute force attacks, implementing a system to limit login attempts and temporarily lock accounts after a certain number of failed attempts would be beneficial.

## üöÄ Features
- **User management**: Registration and login.
- **Chat**: Allows users to engage in a forum.
- **File management**: Uploading, viewing, and deleting files.
- **Administration**: User management by administrators, including role updates.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.
- **Database**: MongoDB.
- **Frontend**: EJS for views, with CSS and JS files for styling and interactive functionalities.

## üìù How to Use
1. **Installation**:
   - Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/WinnieTheBloue/Chat-my-Files.git`
   - Install dependencies: `npm install`

2. **Configuration**:
   - Configure your MongoDB database and other environment variables.

3. **Launching the Application**:
   - Start the application with `npm start`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup
To run this project, you need to set up the environment variables. Follow these steps to configure them:

1. **Copy the example file**: Start by creating a copy of the `.env.example` file. You can do this by running:
   `cp .env.example .env`
   This command creates a new file named `.env` with the same contents as `.env.example`.

2. **Edit the `.env` file**: Open the `.env` file in your preferred text editor. You'll see various placeholders for configuration values. Replace these placeholders with your actual configuration values. For example:
   - **your_username**: Your MongoDB username.
   - **your_password**: Your MongoDB password.
   - **your_cluster_url**: Your MongoDB cluster URL.
   - **your_jwt_secret**: A secret key for JWT.
3. **Save the `.env` file**: After replacing all the placeholders with your actual values, save the file.
4. **Restart the server**: If your server was running, restart it to apply the new environment variables.
